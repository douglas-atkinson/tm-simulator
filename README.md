# Turing Machine Simulator

This repository contains the source code for the **Turing Machine (TM) simulator** used in COSC 2425 (Computer Organization).

The simulators are designed as **teaching tools**, allowing you to:
- step through computations
- visualize tape/head movement
- run machines with animation
- inspect configuration traces
- experiment with machine definitions
